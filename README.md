# Content-based-machine-learning-movie-recommendation-system

A recommender system or a recommendation system (sometimes replacing “system” with a synonym such as platform or engine) is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the “rating” or “preference” a user would give to an item

The idea behind Content-based (cognitive filtering) recommendation system is to recommend an item based on a comparison between the content of the items and a user profile.In simple words,I may get recommendation for a movie based on the description of other movies.
The theory behind collaborative filtering to work with collaboration with user or movie id.For example, there are two user A and B, user A likes movie P,Q,R,S and user B like movies Q,R,S,T. Since movies Q, R and S are similar to both user, therefore, movie P will be recommended to user B and movie T will be recommended to used A.<\br>
